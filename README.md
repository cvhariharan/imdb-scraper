## IMDB WebScraper
Just a very basic library for scraping IMDB. Refer to the scraping_example script for details on how to use the library.

### I am not responsible for any illegal use of this library. Use this library at your own risk. IMDB doesn't yet officially allow scraping.

If you get an encoding error, it's beacuse of the encoding used by the console. In Windows, run command `chcp 65001`.
